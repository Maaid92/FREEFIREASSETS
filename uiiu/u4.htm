<h2>Download HiiU for PC Windows 10,8,7 using Bluestack Emulator- <span style="color: #ff0000;">Method #1 </span></h2>
<p>Bluestack is one of the leading android emulators out there in terms of usability and downloaded number. It is extremely efficient with cool inbuilt features and we strongly recommend to use Bluestacks to download and use HiiU on your PC. So let’s go ahead and see the step by step installation guide:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 1</strong>: We start the procedure by downloading Bluestacks. It’s a straightforward procedure to download and install Bluestack on your computer but you can check the detailed tutorial on how to <a href="https://droidtopc.com/download-bluestacks-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>download and install Bluestacks for PC</strong></a> if you want to<strong>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Step 2</strong>: Once you have successfully downloaded and installed Bluestack, I would recommend you to restart your computer that the system can adjust with the latest change and configure accordingly.</li>
<li><strong>Step 3</strong>: Now go ahead and open Bluestack by clicking on the shortcut button created on your computer home screen. It may initially take some time to load the bluestack app depending on your computer configuration and performance.</li>
<li><strong>Step 4</strong>: Once the emulator is opened, you will notice Google play store is already pre-installed in Bluestacks. Double click on the playstore icon to open it. (Bluestack is working as an android device but the interesting fact is, you can use your mouse and keyboard to operate like you normally do).</li>
<li><strong>Step 5</strong>: In playstore, search for HiiU app and once you find it go-ahead to install the app on your computer.</li>
<li><strong>Step 6</strong>: Once you click on the installation button, the app will be installed on bluestacks. A shortcut app icon will be displayed on the bluestack home screen like they usually do on the Android home screen. Alternatively, you can also locate the installed app under the option of ‘<strong>list of installed apps’ </strong>in Bluestacks.</li>
</ul>
<p>The installation procedure is now complete. Now double click on the installed HiiU for PC and start using like to normally do in a smartphone. There is literally no differenc and you can set up hotkeys using the Bluestacks settings option.</p>
<p>If the app is not available on Playstore to download, then you can opt in for an alternative approach. Bluestack has an inbuilt option to upload and Install APK file. Hover over to “upload APK” section &gt; locate the APK file in your system and then click to upload. Once it finished uploading, extract it for installation and there you have your favorite app installed on your computer device.</p>
<p>The latest BlueStacks4 is smooth, superfast and efficient. Performance is almost unmatchable for other emulators for a number of reasons. However, it might require a minimum system configuration for optimal performance while using high-end graphic apps.</p>
<p>Bluestacks is the preferred approach to use HiiU Mobile app for PC but in case you would like to use another emulator, we recomend <strong>MemuPlay. </strong>Scroll down to the below section to know more.</p>
