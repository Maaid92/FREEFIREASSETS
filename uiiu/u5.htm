<h2>Download HiiU for PC Windows 10,8,7 using MEmu Play Emulator- <span style="color: #ff0000;">Method #2</span></h2>
<p>If we really have to find an alternative emulator for Bluestacks, we have to consider MEmu Play. This emulator has been programmed and designed for a seamless Gaming experience. If you want to play <strong>High-end-Graphic games like Need For SPEED, PUBG, Call of Duty, etc., </strong>then MEmu should be the preferred approach. Even we have witnessed much better performance than Bluestcks when it comes to consider playing High-End Android games on PC. Let’s move forward and Download HiiU for PC using MEmu Play emulator.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 1</strong>: We need the MEmu Play on our system. So download and install the software from the <a href="https://www.memuplay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>official MEmu Play Website</strong></a>.</li>
<li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once the emulator is downloaded, I would suggest you to restart the computer thatthe system can get adjusted with the recent change and configure accordingly for optimal performance. (Make sure to restart the computer whenever you install any heavy software in your system)</li>
<li><strong>Step 3</strong>: Now click on MEmu Icon on your desktop to open it and from there navigate to Google Playstore, which has already been preinstalled in the latest MEmu Play Emulator version.</li>
<li><strong>Step 4</strong>: It’s time to install HiiU on your PC using MEmu Play. Search the App name on Google Playstore and install the app like you normally do in your smartphone.</li>
<li><strong>Step 5</strong>: There you are! Once the installation process is completed, you will see the newly installed HiiU shortcut app icon on the home screen of MEmu Play.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from Bluestacks and MEmu play, you can consider trying Ko Player, Nox Player, Andyroid to download HiiU for PC. They have similar functionality and you might even find some of them perform better with your computer configaration. But Bluestacks and MEmu play are recommended as they both are industry pioneers with regular upgrades to match the latest android inventions and outperform their peer competitors by quite a mile.</p>
