<h1 class="post-title entry-title">Hair Challenge Strategy Guide – Best Tips, Tips, Strategies</h1>
<p>Hair Challenge is a game that grows hair for as long as possible. You will pick up the extension and soon have a huge, flowing sword. Of course, there are obstacles in your path. In other words, a lot of rotating circular saws. And some razor blades. And some holes. </p>
<p>If it sounds a little scary, don’t worry. We played a significant part of the game and found a whole bunch of tips, hints and tricks that could overcome even the most difficult challenges the game poses to you.</p>
<p>So if you want to get the longest hair in the digital world, this guide is exactly what you’ve been waiting for. Here are 5 tips, tips, and cheats for hair challenges without any extra typing.</p>
<h2>Release your finger to stop</h2>
<p>When you take your finger off the screen, it will stop walking. This is a very important skill. This gives you the opportunity to look at the obstacles in front of you and come up with the best course of action. It’s also a good way to prevent your hair from fluttering and to keep it straight and calm.</p>
<h2>Swipe quickly to flick your hair</h2>
<p>Controlling your hair is just as important as controlling your feet. This is especially true when walking a circular saw in a zigzag manner. The faster you swipe, the more chances your hair will flick back and through the maze, leaving it intact. Or, more accurately, not shaving.</p>
<h2>Think about what’s behind you</h2>
<p>You need to think about what you just passed, not just focus on the obstacles in front of you. This is the key to success here. The difference between long rock and buzz cut. </p>
<h2>Don’t fall into the hole</h2>
<p>There may be gaps in the runway. If you make a mistake, you may fall and finish the run, so be careful. If you give any hole a large sleeper, it will work.</p>
<h2>Correct timing</h2>
<p>This is one of the most important things in the game. If you find a way to get over obstacles without damaging them, you’ll want to repeat the same movement every time. It’s not always easy, but you can get big scores by timing with stricter hazards.</p>
